    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Put a healthier family classic on the dinner table by substituting ground
      turkey for ground beef, and using frozen riced cauliflower instead of
      high-carb white rice.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>nonfat cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
      <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons diced fresh jalapeno pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups frozen cauliflower rice (such as Green Giant®)</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sambal oelek chili paste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>
        2 large bell peppers, any color - cut in half lengthwise, cored, and
        seeded
      </li>
      <li>4 (1 inch) cubes Colby-Jack cheese</li>
      <li>aluminum foil</li>
      <li>⅓ cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons reduced-fat sour cream</li>
      <li>8 slices pickled jalapeno peppers (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking dish
        with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in ground
        turkey, onion, jalapeno, and garlic. Cook and stir until turkey browns
        and vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain grease from the
        skillet. Add frozen riced cauliflower, tomatoes, tomato sauce, water,
        chili paste, salt, and pepper; stir until well incorporated. Reduce heat
        and simmer for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place bell pepper halves in the prepared baking dish. Place 1 Colby-Jack
        cheese cube in each pepper half, and fill with turkey mixture. Spoon
        remaining turkey mixture into the dish around the peppers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover dish with aluminum foil, and bake in the preheated oven for 30
        minutes. Remove foil and sprinkle each pepper with shredded Colby-Jack
        cheese. Bake, uncovered, until peppers are soft and cheese has melted,
        about 10 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, spoon a little turkey mixture onto a plate, and place a bell
        pepper half on top of it. Top each serving with 1 teaspoon sour cream
        and 2 jalapeno slices.
      </li>
    </ol>
