Creation of the Recipes project from The Odin Project

The project consists of the creation of an index page linking to three recipe pages. The purpose is to practice creating pages using heavily used HTML elements.

I am already familar with these elements but it is always good to get a refresher. The main skill I learned on this project was the process of pushing my code to GitHub through git commands in the terminal. I haven't had the need to learn git so this is a good opportunity to learn it through projects such as this one.
